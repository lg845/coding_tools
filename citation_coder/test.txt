Dr. Cavva told Mr. Silva that Mrs. Silva was studying with Ms. Brown. This other sentence is supposed to “contain a citation with a quote and a period before the closing quotation mark.” (Author, 2017) This is weirs because then this sentence starts after the in-text citation, with no period in between.
	This paragraph starts with a tab. And then there are some that have “a quote and a period.” (p. 45) And a page number. Sometimes the “quotation ends.” (para. 10) And there is a paragraph number instead, I think that is what this is. And then there are citations that use “pg” instead of just p for page numbers (Author, 2017, pg. 10), which makes like a little hard sometimes and it can also be something (Author, 2017, p. 9) that is like this. And there is also prof. Staples or Prof. Carvalho maybe? In the references there is a Vol. 10 sometimes. There are also cases where there are periods with no spaces after.This is a big problem. Besides the B.S. problem there is also things like (U.N. between parentheses). There is also, besides vol. info, info on art. 10. There is a "citation here and then is it supposed to end" .2 And a new sentence starts.

And the “there is a long citation.” (Author, 2017). Note how the previous sentence has two final periods. There are also problems when “there is a citation” (p. 1), and the sentence continues after a comma. When citing sources, students put “the tile within quotes with a quotation mark?”, which is confusing.
