The Dancing Fox: A Sample Paper in APA Style

This sample paper will lay out some guidelines for papers written in the American Psychological Association (APA) style. Most academic papers are written in third person (“One can see…research shows…the author suggests…”); avoid first-person point of view (I, we, our, etc.) and second-person point of view (you) in academic papers. All of the paper is doublespaced, aligned left, and in Times New Roman, 12-point font. Margins are one inch. Two spaces after punctuation marks at the end of a sentence is (only) recommended (APA, 2010, p. 88). The title on the first page is centered, double-spaced, and not bold. Each new paragraph is indented half an inch. Unless requested by the instructor, do not use a heading titled “Introduction” (APA, 2010, pp. 63-64). Write out acronyms the first time mentioned, such as American Psychological Association for APA. 
If acronyms first appear inside parentheses, use brackets (American Word Play [AWP], 2009). Write out acronyms again in the references.

Here is the second paragraph. It is the beginning of a section with a heading. This sample paper only uses one level of headings, so each heading is centered and in boldface. See the handout on APA heading levels (available on the Writing Center website) if employing more than one level. Do not capitalize articles (a, an, the) in headings unless they begin a title or follow a colon. Avoid contractions. Capitalize each main word in headings, including hyphenated compound words. Six-Year Study on Foxes, and Self-Consciousness of a Vixen are examples of headings with compound words (FitzPat & Whaler, 1999, A4, A6). Use p. for one page and pp. for more than one. Use para. for one paragraph and paras. for two or more. Separate non-consecutive page numbers with commas; separate different sets of authors with semicolons (Ames, 2003; Bugga & Miner, 1998; Duvall, Walker, & Jensch, 1996).
