Sentence_Number	Sentence	Code	Citation1	How is the Job Market for People with a B.S.  		2	in Biology?		3	In this synthesis paper, I will continue to look into the strategies and skills for going into the job market with a B.S.  		4	in biological sciences.  		5	I will interpret relevant and published material from professionals' perspectives using my experiences and observations.  		6	In these articles, professionals have addressed what it means to be studying biology and to be going into the job market with a degree in biology.  	integral	FALSE7	The published works that are going to be analyzed are (1) "What Does It Mean to Study Biology?"  	integral	TRUE8	an article from WorldWideLearn.com, (2) "Skills Developed In The Biology Major" an article from the One Day One Job website, and (3) an essay by the Science Magazine of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), "Promoting alternative careers: An adviser's responsibility" published in 2016 by Elisabeth Pain.  		9	In this paper, I will summarize, synthesize, contrast, and connect the perspectives of these three works.		10	In the first article published on the WorldWideLearn website, specifically in the Biology Major's Guide section, the author (unknown) explains the foundations of what the job market is based on for people with a degree in biology.  	integral	TRUE11	The author ultimately presents biology as the study of living systems.  	integral	TRUE12	This explanation of biology at the beginning is essential for the four main discussion points discussed throughout the article, which are: "trends in biology careers", "still in high school?  	integral	FALSE13	How to prepare for a degree in biology", "career education in biology", and "What can you do with a degree in biology?".  		14	In terms of trends in biology careers, it appears that there are lots of job titles for working in the fields of healthcare, research, environment, agriculture, or forensics is definitely a vast majority of the graduates ("What does it mean to study biology?", n.d.).  	non-integral	TRUE15	Interestingly, this point is correlated with the statistics of Purdue University CCO, which suggest the same trend.  	integral	TRUE16	The list of a number of possible careers with a degree in biology seems hopeful for biological science students.  		17	It is emphasized that at least a bachelor's degree level will enable most of these opportunities among associate degrees or certificate programs.  		18	This, in fact should be the most significant preparation to consider while preparing for a career in biological sciences.  		19	However, since all of these careers are achievable with the same degree, there are also common additional tips for preparing.  		20	For high school students, they include volunteering, job shadowing, writing practice, and being involved in student clubs.  		21	It is likely that current biology majors have done the same for their preparation.  		22	Different to preparing in high school, the author notes that a helpful way to prepare for recruitment in the field of biological sciences after graduation is by taking advantage of "minor and elective programs to build unique sets of skills that can qualify them for highly specialized positions" ("What does it mean to study biology?", n.d.). &nbsp; 	hybrid	TRUE23	Specifically, "undergraduate research" and "internships" are emphasized as two main opportunities to acquire these skills.  		24	Therefore, being involved in order to continue demonstrating your interest in the field is important for any recruitment related to the field of biological sciences.		25	The second article is published by a popular career exploring website discusses important skills that should be developed while studying biology, which are valuable to recruiters .  		26	The author (unknown) begins by talking about the biology major and states that biology is becoming a more popular major, being 5.25% of all degrees awarded in the 2010-2011 academic year ("biology", n.d.).  	hybrid	TRUE27	The author mentions the skills valuable to recruiters in two different categories.  	integral	TRUE28	The first is the skills that are efficiently acquired thanks to the current curriculum of most degrees in biology in many universities.  		29	The second category is what the author implies as the skills that the students are slowly starting to gain thanks to the new curriculums in many improving universities.  	integral	FALSE30	Skills of the first category include deep knowledge regarding living organisms and practice with the universal scientific methodology.  		31	Skills of the second category include critical thinking, computing knowledge, and leadership skills.  		32	After elaborating on the skills, the author suggests that the reason why these skills are valuable to recruiters is that the recruiters not only care about &nbsp;whether or not the individual is accomplishing the task he/she is assigned, but also what new contribution the individual will bring to the company.  	integral	TRUE33	Examples of this can be starting a new project for the company or establishing beneficial relationships with other employees within the company.  	non-integral	FALSE34	The author concludes his argument in a hopeful way by mentioning some of the possible careers with a degree in biology, however, from more of a real life perspective compared to an academic perspective of the first article because how some of the skills mentioned earlier are critical to be successful in the particular job is mentioned within the description of each career.	integral	FALSE35	The third article by Elisabeth Pain, one of the popular authors in the Science Magazine, is based on an interview with Lynn Kamerlin, an associate professor in the department of cell and molecular biology in Uppsala University in Sweden.  	integral	TRUE36	During the interview, the questions asked are based on the strategies Kamerlin uses to prepare her students for the job market and her advice for them.  	non-integral	FALSE37	The question that is going to be discussed for the purpose of this summary related to my research is about career options for graduate students in (micro) biology.  	non-integral	FALSE38	The question Pain asks is "What are the biggest issues in todays academic job market?"  	hybrid	TRUE39	(Pain, 2016).  		40	Although this question differs from the perspective of other articles because it is about graduate students, it can be related to undergraduate students because the cycle of deciding a career has a lot of similarities between every stage of education.  		41	Kamerlin's answer reported emphasizes one significant problem, which is the availability of space.  	integral	FALSE42	As someone running a research in her own department in the university, Kamerlin mentions the realistic fact that although she is doing something great, the number of people who can participate in it is not as huge.  		43	Therefore, the recommended strategy is to definitely consider the alternatives, such as other universities or even careers outside of academia, like research.  	non-integral	FALSE44	However, Kamerlin argues that this does not have to mean switching interests or career plans because she believes that other than being more specialized in a particular topic, completing a masters or a Ph.D.  	non-integral	FALSE45	also means having more experience in critical thinking and problem solving skills.  		46	According to Kamerlin, this is something that should be "promoted".  	non-integral	FALSE47	Therefore, it can be learned from this article that it is important for biological science students specifically interested in academic careers to have a useful game plan in mind as a solution to the problem of limited space for academic careers.  	integral	FALSE48	However, the idea of having a realistic game plan can be generalized to many careers within the field of biological sciences. 		49	Although all three of these articles mention the variety of possible interests that can lead to different career opportunities, these points are mentioned from different perspectives.  	integral	FALSE50	The first article does an efficient job of connecting the basis of biological sciences as academic study with matching career paths.  	integral	FALSE51	The second article mentions skills that support students that have varieties of dreams and argues that these skills can support their achievements.  		52	The third article argues that a realistic career plan that still enables one to achieve their goals is about having passions that can relate to multiple types of careers.  		53	Going through the articles, a trend I notice is that choosing a career path in the field of biology can be the most rewarding when it is done in a more of a spontaneous process rather than strict planning and certainty.  		54	Although many careers in biology are similar to each other, all of them still arise from different interests.  		55	It is possible that to succeed in a career in the field of biological sciences, the valuable tips and the important skills to acquire in terms of preparation for a career are more useful for some careers than for others.  		56	Therefore, having a game plan that is too strict might decrease the diversity of skills a person is exposed to, while preparing for a life-long career.  		57	This is something I have not considered as much in terms of a strategy in going into the job market and also something I intend to become more open-minded on.		58	Works Cited:		59	Biology.  		60	(n.d.).  		61	Retrieved October 30, 2016, from		62
